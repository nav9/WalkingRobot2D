There are two demo simulators that can be run. Both can be activated or deactivated
from the main.py file. 
The test simulator is for the programmer to try out a feature before programming it
onto a robot.

For the 30 generations trials, only the first two trials are being considered.
The staircase terrain is not being considered for any trial.
